In this Kaggle competition, we are tasked with predicting whether a tweet is related to a disaster. Our objective is to analyze a dataset of labeled tweets and develop a predictive model that classifies each tweet accordingly. This involves preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features, and applying machine learning techniques to train and evaluate our model. The ultimate goal is to accurately identify disaster-related tweets, which can enhance our understanding and response to such events.
